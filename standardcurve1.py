### Welcome to the Lab!
You're part of a biotech team helping a nutrition research group analyze sugar content in beverages using a color-based chemical test called the **DNS assay**. Today, you're going to:

1. Make a **standard curve** using glucose solutions with known concentrations.
2. Use the **DNS assay** to measure how much sugar is in an unknown drink (like a soda or juice).
3. Use the absorbance (color intensity) readings from your samples to **estimate glucose concentration** using your standard curve.

### What is the DNS Assay?
The **DNS assay** (3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid) is a colorimetric test that detects **reducing sugars** like glucose. When DNS reacts with glucose under heat, it turns orange or red â€” the more glucose, the darker the color.

- You measure this color using a **spectrophotometer** at 540 nm.
- The result is called **absorbance** (AU = absorbance units).

### What is a Standard Curve?
A **standard curve** is a graph that shows the relationship between:
- **Known concentrations** of a substance (x-axis)
- Their corresponding **absorbance readings** (y-axis)

Once you graph this data, a **line of best fit** is drawn. This line has an equation in the form:

\[ \text{Absorbance} = m \times \text{Concentration} + b \]

Where:
- \( m \) is the slope (how steep the line is)
- \( b \) is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)

You will use this equation to calculate the glucose concentration of an unknown beverage sample based on its absorbance.

### Why Do We Use Dilutions?
Beverages like soda often contain a lot of sugar. If you test them directly, the absorbance might be **too high** and fall **outside the linear region** of your standard curve.

To fix that, we **dilute** the drink with water â€” for example:
- A **1:10 dilution** means 1 part soda and 9 parts water.

Then you test the diluted sample and use your standard curve to calculate the sugar content in the original drink.

### What is the Linear Region?
The **linear region** is the part of your standard curve where the absorbance increases in direct proportion to concentration.

- This is the most **accurate range** to estimate unknowns.
- If your sample's absorbance is too high or low (outside this range), it may give **inaccurate results**.
