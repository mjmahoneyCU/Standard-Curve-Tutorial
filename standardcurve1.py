Let's use that absorbance data that you collected with the spectrophotometer and create a Standard Curve.
Then, we can use it to determine the amount of sugar in your beverage.

### What is a Standard Curve?
A **standard curve** is a graph that shows the relationship between:
- **Known concentrations** of a substance (x-axis)
- Their corresponding **absorbance readings** (y-axis)

Once you graph this data, a **line of best fit** is drawn. This line has an equation in the form:
""")

    st.latex(r"A = m \times C + b") # st.latex implicitly handles raw strings for LaTeX

    # This block explicitly uses r"""...""" to prevent invalid escape sequence warnings
    st.markdown(r"""
Where:
- \( A \) is Absorbance (AU)
- \( C \) is Concentration (mg/mL)
- \( m \) is the slope (how steep the line is)
- \( b \) is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)

#### **Using the Standard Curve Equation to Find Unknown Concentration (Step-by-Step):**

You've learned that your standard curve gives you an equation:
**Absorbance (A) = slope (m) √ó Concentration (C) + y-intercept (b)**

But what if you know the **Absorbance (A)** of an unknown sample and want to find its **Concentration (C)**? You need to rearrange the equation!

Let's do the algebra together:

1.  **Start with your equation:**
    $A = m \times C + b$

2.  **Move 'b' (y-intercept) to the other side:**
    *Since 'b' is added on the right, subtract 'b' from both sides to move it:*
    $A - b = m \times C$

3.  **Isolate 'C' (Concentration):**
    *Since 'm' is multiplied by 'C' on the right, divide both sides by 'm':*
    """)
st.latex(r" \frac{A - b}{m} = C ") # st.latex implicitly handles raw strings well

# This block explicitly uses r"""...""" to prevent invalid escape sequence warnings
st.markdown(r"""
    So, the final equation to find your unknown concentration is:

st.latex(r" \textbf{Concentration (C) = } \frac{\textbf{Absorbance (A) - y-intercept (b)}}{\textbf{slope (m)}} ") # st.latex implicitly handles raw strings well

# This block explicitly uses r"""...""" to prevent invalid escape sequence warnings
st.markdown(r"""
**Here's how you'll use it in practice (the table below will help):**

1.  Measure your unknown beverage sample's Absorbance (A) using the spectrophotometer.
2.  Your script has already calculated the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) from your standard curve data (look at "Linear Fit Equation" above).
3.  The table below will then take your measured Absorbance (A) and automatically plug these numbers into the rearranged equation to calculate the Estimated Glucose Concentration for your unknown sample.
